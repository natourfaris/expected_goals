    "# Training and Cross-Validating a Predictive Model Using PySpark through the Lens of NHL Expected Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The sports analytics revolution of the past few years has given rise to new ways of evaluating players. Hockey is not an exception. Fans have been using the NHL's public data to calculate statistics that attempt to more accurately and objectively measure player performance. First came *Corsi*, that is shot attempts made by a team, whether they are a goal, saved by goaltender, miss the net, or are blocked on their way towards the net. A team that has a higher Corsi than its opponents is thought to spend more time on the attack and possessing the puck than its opponent. This indicates better quality play. Similarly, players are also tracked for Corsi statistics. In this context, Corsi refers to shot attempts, for and against a team, that occur when a player is on the ice. A player that consistently has a positive Corsi is thought to have a positive effect on play. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of how this works: a player X is on the ice for 3 shot attempts for his team and 1 shot attempt against his team. This means that the player is positive on Corsi. This is usually expressed as a percentage, Corsi For Percentage (CF%), where we divide Corsi For by total Corsi with a player on the ice to obtain. In the case of X, CF% is 3/(3+1) = 3/4 = 75%. This player had a very good effect on his team's performance. Conversely, player Y was on the ice for 8 Corsi For and 12 Corsi Against. This translates to CF% of 8/(8+12) = 8/20 = 40%, which is not very good. In the context of the game of hockey, where players regularly change on and off the ice fluidly as the game is played without a clock stoppage, this helps us see which players had a more positive performance on their team's performance since we have many opportunities to compare team performance with and without the player being active in-game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a measure of course ignores many factors that differentiate different shots. It doesn't into account shot distance or the context in which the shot was made. As such, using Corsi alone to evaluate player or team performance gives us an incomplete picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the role that *expected goals* play. By incorporating more information into our evaluation of team performance, we can get a more accurate picture of how a team or a player played. Expected goals are measured on a shot-by-shot basis, where the xG of a shot is the probability, given the different characteristics of the game at the time of the shot, to be a goal. The higher the xG value, the more likely a shot is to be a goal. We then use aggregate xG values to evaluate a player or a team in much the same way we evaluate them using Corsi. A player with a higher xG recorded for their team than xG against had a positive effect on play while on the ice. Since each shot's factors are mostly independent of each other, we are able to sum xG values because we are adding the the probabilities for independent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "xG works similarly as before: a player is on the ice for 0.73 xGF and 0.35 xGA. Their xGF% is thus 0.73/(0.73+0.35) = 0.73/1.08 = 67.6%. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Setup and How I Will Proceed\n",
    "\n",
    "How will I calculate xG? I can use a model that is calibrated on game events that allows us as much as possible to capture the game situation as a shot is taken. Based on data regarding this shot and many others like it, I can then estimate the likelihood it would have been a goal. Such a model, when trained, can be used to evaluate shots taken when a player is on the ice vs. off the ice, allowing me to estimate shot and team play quality when a player is active in-game. This will be a  Since xG is a probability, the model will estimate the probability of each shot being a goal. Thus I will be estimating a regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options of models to use, as several general models allow us to estimate a regression. But since the process of determining which model to use is not materially different whether we use a logistic regression or, say, a random forest regression, I will use a logistic regression and calibrate its hyperparameters to arrive the optimal xG model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should note that by restricting myself to logistic regression, I am ignoring various possible nonlinearities due to interactions between variables unless I explicitly account for them. Since this is a simple model aimed at demonstrating how to use various features of PySpark, this is fine for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is obtained from [Moneypuck.com](moneypuck.com) who generously provide their cleaned dataset for anyone to use. Moneypuck scrapes the NHL API and uses game events to construct its dataset, which includes all unblocked shots taken by all players starting with the 2007-08 season. This data runs until the present data. At the time of writing this, the NHL has suspended its 2019-20 to help in limiting the effects of SARS-COVID-19. We can use this season's data, along with the 2018-19 season as our testing dataset. Data from all seasons before that will be used for training and cross-validation. Once we calibrate our models on the training/CV dataset, we will choose the model that performs best on our test dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variables included in the Moneypuck dataset are extensive and capture many details of what was occuring during the game at the time of the shot. They include variables such as the game score, whether either of the nets was empty, how many players were on the ice for each team (i.e. the game situation), how much time has elapsed in the game, and the shot coordinates. I will use several of these variables to estimate my model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries/Packages Used\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use PySpark for data reading and processing, as well as training, cross-validating, and testing models. I use Pandas to obtain column names. I also use Plotly to graph some of my results.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will import the data, create several variables that we will be using in our model, and then running several models to cross-validate them. After training all models, I will evaluate them on the test dataset and choosing the one that performs best out-of-sample."

    "### Evaluating Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually regressions are evaluated by examining a measure like *R<sup>2</sup>* or RMSE. However, I elected to use a logarithmic scoring rule, specifically the logarithmic loss, to evaluate my predictions, as per [this](https://oddacious.github.io/proper_scoring_rules) great post. One of the features of using log loss as our evaluation metric is that it discourages overly confident predictions. Thus it incentivizes for weighing variables that have a significant effect on the probability of the result of interest: in this case, scoring a goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, PySpark does not have a log loss evaluator available by default. Thus I create it below. Since we would like to *minimize* log loss, I specify that \"bigger is NOT better\" in the appropriate function. This ensures that our evaluator will use this criteria when we run on it on several iterations of the model. "

    "Now I will specify several versions of the model and pick one that seems to perform best. I use several combinations of the variables and test them over a range of possible values for the hyperparameters of the model. For the logistic regression model in PySpark, the regularization term is:\n",

    "for $\\alpha\\in[0,1], \\lambda \\geq 0$. In this case, $\\begin{Vmatrix}\\mathbf{w}\\end{Vmatrix}_1$ is the $L_1$ regularization term (Lasso regularization), and $\\begin{Vmatrix}\\mathbf{w}\\end{Vmatrix}_2^2$ is the $L_2$ regularization term (ridge regularization). In the case where $\\lambda=0$, there is no regularization. In the case where $\\alpha=1$ and $\\lambda > 0$, we have a lasso regression, while the case of $\\alpha=0$ and $\\lambda > 0$ is a ridge regression. If $0<\\alpha<1$, we have a combination of the two regularization factors. I will test a range of values for $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$ in my cross-validation process and determine which is the best model for each combination of features. Once the best model for each set of features has been found, I will then test the performance of each best model on the test data and select the model that performs best out-of-sample.\n",

    "Now that I set up my data and my evaluator, I can proceed with training and testing of the models. I train several models, testing various hyperparameter values through cross-validation. I use the default k=3 of the k-fold CrossValidator class of PySpark. What this means is that PySpark will divide the training dataset into 3 parts, or folds. It will train a model with a specific combination of hyperparameters in the parameter grid using 2 of those folds. It will then test its performance on the 3rd fold, calculating the evaluation metric (in our case the log loss) for the test fold. It will repeat this process twice more, using one of the other 2 folds as the testing fold. The log loss for this set of hyperparameters is the average log loss calculated for each fold. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do this process for each combination of $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda$ in the parameter grid. Once that's done, we find the model with the lowest log loss and designate it as the \"best model\" for a certain combination of features. This gives us the \"best foot forward\" model for every combination of features/type of model we are considering. At this point, in order to choose between these \"best foot forward\" models, we evaluate the performance of each one on the testing dataset which we have left untouched up to this point. The model that performs best on the test dataset is the model we choose as our model to use.\n",
